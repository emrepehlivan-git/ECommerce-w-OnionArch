- **ORM:** Entity Framework Core.
- **Middleware:** MediatR for CQRS and Pipeline Behaviors.
- **Authentication:** ASP.NET Identity with JWT.
- **Frontend (future):** React.js or Next.js (for API integration).

#### **4.2 Architectural Pattern**

- **Onion Architecture**
  - Domain Layer
    - Core business logic, domain entities, and value objects.
  - Application Layer
    - CQRS handlers, service interfaces, and DTOs.
  - Infrastructure Layer
    - Database context, repositories, and external services.
  - Presentation Layer (API)
    - Controllers, endpoints, and response models.

#### **4.3 Patterns and Practices**

- **CQRS:**
  - Queries and Commands segregated for better readability and scalability.
- **Repository Pattern:**
  - Encapsulate database access logic.
- **Pipeline Behaviors:**
  - Logging, Validation, and Authorization as middleware in the MediatR pipeline.
